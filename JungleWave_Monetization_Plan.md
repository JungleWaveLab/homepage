## 📊 Strategic Analysis & Revenue Model

### 1. Target Audience (The "Explorer")
*   **Primary:** 20-30s Reptile Beginners (Crested Gecko owners). They value *aesthetics* over complex husbandry. They want a "piece of nature" in their room, not just a pet box.
*   **Secondary:** Interior Design enthusiasts who want a vivarium as a "living object".
*   **Pain Point:** "I want a cool jungle tank, but it's too hard to make and maintain."
*   **Solution:** "Jungle Wave makes it easy. Just pour the soil, plant the kit, and use the App to manage it."

### 2. Revenue Streams
*   **Cash Cow (High Vol):** **Smart Store Sales** (Bio Soil, Decorations). The App's *Calculator* is the primary driver here.
*   **Star (High Margin):** **Custom Vivarium Orders**. The App's *Gallery/Shop* serves as a portfolio.
*   **Retention Hook:** **Consumables Subscription** (Food, Calcium). The App's *Feeding Diary* reminds users to restock.

### 3. Execution Plan (Code Implementation)
Our agents have decided on the following **immediate updates** to the app to maximize revenue:

#### A. The "Lock-in" Strategy (Product & Growth)
*   **Action:** Modify `Calculator` to display **Specific Product Bundles** (e.g., "Standard Tank Starter Kit") instead of just liters.
*   **Why:** Don't sell soil; sell the *outcome* (a finished tank).

#### B. The "Social Proof" Engine (Marketing)
*   **Action:** Enhance `Community` to feature "Best Vivarium of the Month".
*   **Why:** User content drives desire for other users to upgrade their tanks.

#### C. The "VIP Access" (Revenue)
*   **Action:** Add a "Consulting" or "Custom Order" button in the `Shop` tab that links directly to a higher-touch channel (e.g., KakaoTalk Open Profile or Google Form), separate from the generic Smart Store link.
*   **Why:** High-ticket items (300k+ KRW) need a consultation channel, not a cart button.
